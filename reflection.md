During this IDP, I learned how to use a class to create a shape. In my project, I have two classes, one for a circle and one for a rectangle. In each class, there were values that constructed the shape. For example, there was an x value, y value, width, height, and a z value. The z value was a random value that was generated to be used for the height's and width's noise. Inside of the class, the z value was updated, which allowed movement for the updating height and width of the circle, and the height of the rectangle. I learned how to use perlin noise for the movement of my shapes. I learned how to use arrays to store my shapes and push them onto the screen. I learned how to use loops to add multiple shapes. While I was doing this project, I only knew how to add shapes to an array. Now I know how to remove them from the array. A revision that I made was removing a shape from the screen when a certain key is pressed. I used the function pop to remove the shapes. In my final project, the user can add and remove circles and rectangles.
