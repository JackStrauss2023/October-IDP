I used perlin noise to create a line that changes randomly based unpon similar values near it. This line's x and y position is changing and updating on the screen. As a result, the line is moving rigth to left and up to down.

During this work period, I made my project interactive for the user. I added key pressed functions to my code that update and change the line that goes across the screen.

I added rectangles that fill the width of the screen on the top and bottom. Their height changes through the noise function. During the next work period, I wanted to have the rectangles move at different heights. But, I was unable to do that and all the rectangles have the same height and change to the same height.

During this work period, I created a circle that moves based on perlin noise. This circle has a realistic and smooth movement to it.

In the last work period, I made a circle that moves with perlin noise, but there was only one circle on the screen. My goal for the work period was to add multiple circles when you press a certain key. I was able to do this by creating a class for the circle, which allowed me to add more circles on the screen. I was also able to finish my idea with the rectangles that I started in previous work periods. I was able to have the rectangles move at different heights through making a class for the rectangle.
